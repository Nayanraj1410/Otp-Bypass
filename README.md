OTP Bypass Project Description
This project demonstrates an OTP (One-Time Password) bypass technique performed on the website Bakingo. The focus is on understanding security vulnerabilities related to OTP verification and exploring how they can be exploited using web security testing tools.

For this project, I used Burp Suite, a powerful web vulnerability scanner and penetration testing tool, to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. This helped in analyzing the OTP flow and crafting bypass methods to demonstrate potential security flaws.

The objective of this project is purely educational, aimed at learning about web security testing, improving penetration testing skills, and raising awareness about securing authentication mechanisms.

Website tested: Bakingo
Tool used: Burp Suite
